Game development is one of the most common reasons to start to study programming. With me it was not different, despite not following the game developer path, this was always a field that caught my attention.

I'm creating this series of posts to learn more about the game development basics and to share my discoveries with everyone. I'll use the [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/) library as tool and I will start by the most basic principles of game development until the creation of a single player **pong like** game.

To reach this goal I'll start with [Structured Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming) focused at the basics of **game development** and **pygame** to make it more comfortable for beginners. As the series goes I'll refactor the code to introduce [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) concepts.

The code used on this series will be running at **Python 3**

## Pygame

**Pygame** is a set of Python modules designed to make games. It uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) which is a cross-platform library that abstracts the multimedia components of a computer as audio and video and allows an easier development of programs that uses this resources.

### Installation

Before starting the installation process you must have python installed at your system. In case you don't have it check this [installation guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/) first.

The **pygame** installation itself can be different from an **OS** and can be checked for more details at its [official install guide](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame Installation).

But, to install it into a **Debian** based system such as **Ubuntu** you must first make sure its dependencies are installed:

```console
$ sudo apt-get build-dep python-pygame
```

After that install **pygame** at your **virtualenv**:

```console
$ pip install pygame
```

Or system wide:

```console
$ sudo pip install pygame
```

### Hello World

As usual, when we are learning something new in programming we start as small as possible to check it everything is working properly before proceeding with the studies.

To make that let's create a file called `hello.py` with the following content:

```python {linenos=table}
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import time

import pygame

pygame.init()

screen = pygame.display.set_mode([640, 480])

pygame.display.set_caption('Hello World')

screen.fill([0, 0, 0])

pygame.display.flip()

time.sleep(5)
```

Then we just need to run it:

```console
$ python hello.py
```

So the result will be this:

![hello](assets/hello.png)

It's still far from a game, but we can see some basic concepts to be discussed.

The three first lines are common to the most programs written in python. At the first line, we define the file encoding used by the python interpreter which was **utf-8**. This line is most common at codes written in python 2 that has non **ASCII** characters, if you are using python 3 you probably won't use it because **utf-8** is the default encoding already. The second and third code lines are importing the python libraries that will be responsible for all the magic.

The command `pygame.init()` starts all modules that need initialization inside pygame.

At `pygame.display.set_mode` we create an area for the game window at the size of 640x480 pixels, followed by `pygame.display.set_caption` were we set the value "Hello World" to our window title.

With the window created we can use the command `fill` from `screen` to fill it with the black color. The colors are passed on a list of three elements that represent the values from RGB. Each value can go from 0 to 255. You can change the values to see by yourself the window changing its color.

The command `pygame.display.flip` represents an important concept to pygame and game development itself. When we use commands to draw at the screen, we are actually drawing a  virtual surface at the memory that represents a portion of our actual screen. To make that drawing visible to the user we need to send it to the actual screen, and we do it in these two separate steps to prevent from displaying incomplete frames to the user. It is like drawing at a board and then "flipping it" to people see what we drew.

And then, to finish the command `sleep` from the library `time` makes the program to wait 5 seconds before finish the execution. Otherwise, the program would close before we see the result.

## Conclusion

Now we finish our first chapter by presenting the library and writing our first program. The code of it can be checked at this repositóry: [exploring-pygame](https://github.com/humrochagf/exploring-pygame/tree/master/01-introduction).

We meet again at the nexts chapters were we will describe the base concepts of game development inside pygame.
